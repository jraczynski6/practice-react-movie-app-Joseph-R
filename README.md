React State Management and Event Handling | Lesson 1

Practice: React Movie App

Instructions

You will create a simple React application where users can:

1. Select a movie genre from a dropdown menu.

2. See a list of movies based on the selected genre.

3. View a loading message while the app "fetches" movie data.

4. Display an error message if no genre is selected and the user tries to fetch
data.

Steps:

1. Initial Setup

● Create a React app.

● Create a component named MovieSelector.

2. Requirements

● Use state to manage:

○ selectedGenre (string): Tracks the currently selected genre.

○ isLoading (boolean): Indicates if the app is "loading" movie data.

○ error (string): Stores error messages, if any.

○ movies (array): Holds the list of movies for the selected genre.

3. Functionality

● Dropdown menu to select a genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).

● Button to "Fetch Movies" for the selected genre.

● Display a list of movies after "fetching."

● Show a loading spinner while fetching data.

● Display an error message if no genre is selected.
